It's fall, which means the heady summer days of listening almost nonstop to the Grateful Dead are slowing down only to be supplanted with artists who are a bit more melancholy.

The complicated Warren Zevon is an artist who is near the top of this list, and [a recently published essay by Steven Hyden in the Ringer](https://www.theringer.com/music/2018/9/7/17830460/warren-zevon-career-music-albums) describes a lot of what makes the cantankerous Zevon so interesting.

This essay dovetails lovely with a recent find: [a rare recording of Zevon on the beloved Cleveland radio station WMMS](https://www.relisten.net/warren-zevon/1976/10/13). Both versions—[one with the interview](https://www.relisten.net/warren-zevon/1976/10/13?source=43442), [and the one without](https://www.relisten.net/warren-zevon/1976/10/13?source=43438)—are well worth your time.
