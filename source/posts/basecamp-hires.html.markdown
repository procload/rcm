This isn’t in my line of work, but shit, Basecamp [knows how to write a job description](https://m.signalvnoise.com/were-hiring-a-director-of-operations/):

> What we’re not looking for is a superhero who might be able to put out five fires burning at once by working 80+ hours/week, but a candidate who avoids the drama by following sound building codes, performing regular inspections, and responding to incidents with a tight routine.
