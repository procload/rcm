[This was an excellent listen](https://www.designsystemspodcast.com/episodes/episode/4982ee99/16-adam-argyle-from-google-making-your-design-system-freeing-vs-constraining) of a conversation with Adam Argyle, co-host of [The CSS Podcast](https://pod.link/thecsspodcast), on The Design Systems Podcast.

Well worth your time.
