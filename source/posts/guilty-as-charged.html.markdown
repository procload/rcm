> Yet much as it longs for an earlier era of America, A Billion Little Lights’ greatest nostalgia is for a more recent past, the indie-rock boom years of the late ’00s and early ’10s, when the genre looked as if it could still be a big tent. “Track Mud” opens with images of the Pacific Coast and the Rockies, but mostly it sounds like a postcard from Bon Iver’s Bon Iver. Elsewhere there are shades of the comforting hush of Iron & Wine and the hand-crocheted folk of Sufjan Stevens, alongside the expected generous pinches of War on Drugs.

True words, but [the album](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wild-pink-a-billion-little-lights/) is up my alley.
