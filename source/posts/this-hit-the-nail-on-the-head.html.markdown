Like [Zeldman had read my mind]( [http://www.zeldman.com/2019/05/22/you-got-this/](http://www.zeldman.com/2019/05/22/you-got-this/) ): 

> With every new discovery I made and shared, I felt a sense of mastery and control, and a tingling certainty that I was physically contributing to a better world of the near-future. A world forged in the best tech ever: simple, human-readable HTML.

And this passage too accurately describes my general day-to-day feeling lately:

> I have a confession to make: I love hard, mental, strategic design work. I love going cross-eyed envisioning customer journey options small and large. I love it like I love good typography and icons and layout, and I’m way better at it than I ever was at those things. I love it like I love color schemes, and, again—I’m better at it than I was at those.

> And, stop me if you’ve heard this one, the more strategic I gets, the further from the code I feels.
