I was playing around with [Airtable, a visual database/spreadsheet,](http://airtable.com) the other day and came across how WeWork organizes their UX research using it. One thing I have been noticing at work is we spend a lot of time writing up notes in a central location but after that it's hard to find information which usually results in duplicating work by interviewing the same person or asking the same questions to another person.
 
WeWork’s approach to this is to create a database of research “nuggets” that can be easily found and organized. They ended up creating a whole app around this.
 
There are 3 short articles that explain their process.
