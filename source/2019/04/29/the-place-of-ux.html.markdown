I've always balked at the "modular" approach to UX that Ryan \[writes about in this article\](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-place-of-ux/) and instead favored an integrated effort. His thoughts on domain specific vs. independent UX are interesting as well. 

But the company I'm at now has very and varied domain specific knowledge associated with it, which kind of argues against my push for an always integrated mindset.
