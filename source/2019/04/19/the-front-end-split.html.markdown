I thoroughly enjoyed [this post from Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/journal/15050) about the split between the front of the front-end vs. the back of front-end and how to weigh developer convenience against the user's experience.

> As a user-centred developer, my priority is doing what’s best for end users. That’s not to say I don’t value developer convenience. I do. But I prioritise user needs over developer needs. And in any case, those two needs don’t even come into conflict most of the time. Like I said, from a user’s point of view, it’s irrelevant what text editor or version control system you use.

> It’s no surprise that programmers with this kind of background would treat CSS as damage and find ways to route around it. The many flavours of CSS-in-JS are testament to this. From a programmer’s point of view, this solution has made things easier. Best of all, as long as it’s being done on the server, there’s no penalty for end users. But now the price is paid in the diversity of your team. In order to participate, a Computer Science programming mindset is now pretty much a requirement. For someone coming from a more declarative background—with really good HTML and CSS skills—everything suddenly seems needlessly complex.

This strikes a lot of the same notes from [The Great Divide](https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/) by Chris Coyier.
